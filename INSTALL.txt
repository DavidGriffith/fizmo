 Before building fizmo you want might to take look at the configuration
 settings.  Configuration is done by providing a "config.mk" file, which is
 easiest obtainable by copying a template like "config.default.mk" to
 "config.mk" and then modifying values.

 By default -- if you're simply running "make" -- the build relies on the
 following dependendies:
  - pkg-config is used by the configuration itself to get the build flags
    for most other packages.
  - libfizmo requires libxml2 for .ifiction parsing.
  - libsndifsdl needs sdl-sound and sndfile (the latter one for AIFF-support).
  - libdrilbo relies on X11, Xext, libpng and libjpeg for graphics output.
  - fizmo-ncursesw needs an ncurses-wide build to compile

 With the exception of libxml2, ncurses and libjpeg these should be
 automatically located using pkg-config if they're available. The three
 packages just mentioned often don't provide information for pkg-config,
 so if they're not in a standard location on your system you might have
 to adjust the appropriate NONPKG-variables.

 To start the acutal build, simply invoke "make". If successful, this will
 build the "fizmo-console" and "fizmo-ncursesw" binaries.

 To install the files, invoke "make install" to copy these to the location
 indicated using "INSTALL_PREFIX" in the config.mk file. This will create
 a "bin" or "games", "man" and "share" directories at the destination
 location.
