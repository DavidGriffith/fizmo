 Installing should be as simple as running the following commands:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

 The "configure" script tries to guess the correct values for all the system
 settings and locations of all include files and libraries. If some files
 cannot be found, the script will ask for the required values.

 In addition to the standard parameters, "configure" provides the following
 options:


 --enable-tracing
 For debugging purposes, fizmo can write very extensive logging information
 into a file named "tracelog.txt". The logging can be enabled using this
 option. See also the "--with-glktermw-includedir" and "--with-glktermw-libdir"
 parameters below.


 --enable-glktermw
 Fizmo provides experimental GLK support, which can be activated using this
 option.


 --disable-x11
 This option will disable X11 image display in fizmo-ncursesw.


 --disable-jpeg
 In case JPEG support is not available or not desired, this option will
 disable libdrilbo's JPEG capabilities.


 --disable-png
 In case PNG support is not available or not desired, this option will
 disable libdrilbo's PNG capabilities.


 --disable-sound
 In case SDL is not available or sound support is not desired, sound can
 be disabled using this option.


 --disable-aiff
 In case libsndfile1 is is not available or no AIFF support is required,
 this option will disable AIFF support.


 --with-jpeg-includedir
 If pkg-config cannot provide information about libjpeg, the location of
 the jpeglib.h can be given using this parameter.


 --with-jpeg-libdir
 If pkg-config cannot provide information about libjpeg, the location of
 the libjpeg can be given using this parameter.


 --with-glktermw-includedir
 In case glktermw should be build, the location of the include files must
 be given using this parameter.


 --with-glktermw-libdir
 In case glktermw should be build, the location of the library file must
 be given using this parameter.
