 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 
 The following minimum components need to be installed to build fizmo:
  - A C compiler like gcc or clang
  - make
  - pkg-config

 Strictly speaking it would be possible build fizmo without pkg-config
 by compiling all the necessary modules yourself instead of letting the
 distribution package do this for you. Since pkg-config should however
 be universally available, there shouldn't be any need to do this.

 Debian and derivates:
  apt-get install gcc make pkg-config



 The following components are required to build the ncursesw-frontend:
  - libxml2
  - ncursesw5

 If possible, the following optional components should also be installed:
  - sdl-audio
  - libsndfile1
  - libjpeg
  - libpng
  - X11

 Debian and derivates:
  apt-get install libxml2-dev libncursesw5-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev
  apt-get install libsndfile1-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev



 If you want to build the SDL-based fizmo frontend, you'll need:
  - The freetype2 libraries
  - SDL version 1.2

 Debian and derivates:
  apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libsdl1.2-dev
