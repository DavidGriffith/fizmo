  ABOUT FIZMO

  fizmo represents a generic a Z-Machine interpreter -- "fizmo interprets
  z-machine opcodes" -- supporting all Z-Machine kinds except version 6,
  allowing you to run Infocom-made and most other Z-Machine based interac-
  tive fiction, also called text adventures. It also provides a generalized,
  plain-C interpreter library, as well as interfaces / implementations for
  various display and sound output methods, providing an interpreter-engine
  for you own project, even for closed-source implementations due to it's
  BSD-style license.

  FRONTENDS

  Currently three frontends are available:

  - fizmo-ncursesw
    The default frontend uses ncurses "wide" variant for story output.
    Ncurses is commonly used for output on fixed-width text displays. The
    wide extensions will ensure correct unicode display.

  - fizmo-console
    This frontend will simple read and write from the console / terminal.
    No fance functionality whatsoever, but may be useful for automization
    or voice output.

  - fizmo-glktermw
    An example GLK frontend. Requires glktermw -- notice the trailing "w" --
    which may be downloaded from the Interactive Fiction Archive's "GLK-Im-
    plementations" localted at at http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/
    if-archiveXprogrammingXglkXimplementations.html.



  INTERFACES

  For developers, interfaces translate the Z-machine specific output --
  window management, output, scrolling and so on -- into more display-
  specific commands, easing implementation considerably.

  - libcellif
    This interface will convert output into simple "goto-xy"- and "print"-
    commands, providing support for implementations on a fixed-width display.
    This interface is used by fizmo-ncursesw.

  - libglkif
    The GLK-interface translates Z-Machine output into GLK-specific ins-
    tructions. This is used by Andrew Plotkin's iOS-fizmo.



  LIBRARIES

  - libfizmo
    This provides the interpreter core. It is a plain-C implementation which
    requires no external libraries (libxml2 is used by default, but in case
    babel support is not needed even libxml2 is not required).

  - libdrilbo
    Provides support for jpeg, png and infocom's mg1 image reading as well
    as X11-based output.

  - libsndifsdl
    Supplies a SDL-based sound interface.



  INSTALLATION

  Please see "INSTALL.txt" on how to bulid the packages.



  MISCELLANEOUS

  Please send bug reports (or other requests) to fizmo@spellbreaker.org.
