  <section title="About fizmo">
    <p>fizmo represents a generic a Z-Machine interpreter — “fizmo interprets z-machine opcodes” — supporting all Z-Machine kinds except version 6, allowing you to run Infocom-made and most other Z-Machine based interactive fiction, also called text adventures. It also provides a generalized, plain-C interpreter library, as well as interfaces / implementations for various display and sound output methods, providing an interpreter-engine for you own project, even for closed-source implementations due to it's BSD-style license.</p>
    <ul>

  <section title="Frontends">
    <p>Currently four frontends are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>fizmo-sdl2</i><br/>Using the freetype2 engine, this SDL2-based frontend allows for proportional font display and supports antialiasing, subpixel-rendering and HiDPI support. It uses the “Fira Sans” and “Fira Mono” font faces which were made by Erik Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois.</li>
      <li><i>fizmo-ncursesw</i><br/>This frontend uses ncurses “wide” variant for story output. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/">Ncurses</a> is commonly used for output on fixed-width text displays. The wide extensions will ensure correct unicode display.</li>
      <li><i>fizmo-console</i><br/>This frontend will simple read and write from the console / terminal. No fance functionality whatsoever, but may be useful for automization or voice output.</li>
      <li><i>fizmo-glktermw</i><br/>An example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glk_(software)">Glk</a> frontend. Requires glktermw — notice the trailing “w” — which may be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXglkXimplementations.html">GLK-Implementations</a> at the Interactive Fiction archive.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Interfaces">
    <p>For developers, interfaces translate the Z-machine specific output — window management, output, scrolling and so on — into more display-specific commands, easing implementation considerably.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>libpixelif</i><br/>This interface will convert output into draw-pixel commands, providing support for implementations on any pixel-based display. This interface is used by fizmo-sdl2.</li>
      <li><i>libcellif</i><br/>This interface will convert output into simple “goto-xy”- and “print”-commands, providing support for implementations on a fixed-width display. This interface is used by fizmo-ncursesw.</li>
      <li><i>libglkif</i><br/>The GLK-interface translates Z-Machine output into GLK-specific instructions. This is used by Andrew Plotkin's <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/iosfizmo/">iOS-fizmo</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Libraries">
    <ul>
      <li><i>libfizmo</i><br/>This provides the interpreter core. It is a plain-C implementation which requires no external libraries (libxml2 is used by default, but in case babel support is not needed even libxml2 is not required).</li>
      <li><i>libdrilbo</i><br/>Provides support for jpeg, png and infocom's mg1 image reading as well as X11-based output.</li>
      <li><i>libsndifsdl2</i><br/>Supplies a SDL2-based sound interface.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Installation">
    <p>Please see <tt>INSTALL.txt</tt> on how to bulid the packages.</p>
  </section>

  <section title="Miscellaneous">
    <p>Please send bug reports (or other requests) to <a href="mailto:fizmo@spellbreaker.org">fizmo@spellbreaker.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Fizmo was written by Christoph Ender in 2005 – 2016.</p>

    <p><i>Please note:</i><br/>Currently fizmo is in beta status, meaning it might do unexpected things such as stop with an error message, crash or cleesh your machine into a frog. There is no warranty of any kind whatsoever and you're entirely on your own when running it.</p>
